          The CUS is a vast organization. To ensure that we are addressing all
          fields of student life, the Society has established committees to
          oversee and govern different aspects of the CUS, ranging from academic
          affairs to relations with faculty and the university. The committees
          vary in their functions, and most notably, members of the general
          public can hold seats within these committees and participate in the
          CUSâ€™s planning and operations. Committees play a crucial role in
          helping the CUS support all commerce students during their university
          career.
