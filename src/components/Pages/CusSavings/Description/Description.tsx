              CUSavings is Sauderâ€™s very own student benefits program, initiated
              by the CUS External portfolio to support our students and local
              businesses. CUSavings aims to provide value to our students by
              alleviating their financial stress. With COVID-19, we realized a
              need for support and wanted to help students save money through
              various benefits. We also want to support to our community and our
              local businesses that have been impacted by COVID-19.
